Here in this file you can see the list of beginner-friendly project ideas based on the concepts covered in this Python training course.  
These projects are designed to help you strengthen your understanding of core Python concepts such as syntax, control flow, functions, and data structures. As you progress, you need to use object-oriented programming, file handling, and working with custom modules. Later projects introduce essential libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` for data analysis and visualization.

> **Note:** Learning is a continuous journey. You don’t have to know everything — just stay curious, keep exploring, and keep improving.
