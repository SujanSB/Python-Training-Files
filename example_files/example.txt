The Evolution of Our World

Earth formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago from cosmic dust and gas.
Initially, it was a hostile environment with frequent volcanic activity and meteor impacts.

Life emerged around 3.5 billion years ago, starting with simple single-celled organisms.
Through millions of years of evolution, these simple life forms developed into more complex organisms.

Major evolutionary milestones:
- First bacteria and archaea
- Development of photosynthesis
- Emergence of multicellular organisms
- Cambrian explosion (rapid diversification of animal life)
- First land plants and animals
- Rise of dinosaurs
- Evolution of mammals
- Emergence of early humans

Today, our world continues to evolve through both natural processes and human influence.
Climate change, technological advancement, and human activity shape the ongoing evolution of Earth's ecosystems and species.
